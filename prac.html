<pre>    What is Nodejs
Nodejs is asynchronous,runtime js environment.It is used to run js outside the browser.It can be used as Backend
The main advantage is it uses asynchronous architecture ,so when it takes request,even without sending the response,it can
take multiple request and send response when its task is completed

Why does nodejs perform aynchronous
Bcaz it performs non-blocking operations,it will continously accept requests,i.e irrespective of wheather the response is received or not

What are blocking and non-blocking operations
blocking operations wait until the certain operation is finished

What is mean by open source
Any one can access it for free
Cross platform means different devices can use it ,irresepective of which platform it is..


What is npm
Npm is a library and registry for installing js modules .We can install some thousands of modules using npm.It is opensource 

Two main features of npm 
It  works as a command line utility to install packages
It works as an Online repository for node.js packages/modules Where 
everyone can share Tools written in Javascript

What are modules
Modules are reusable code 
Instead of Creating functionality from the scratch ,we can import it and use it 

Require keywod 
require() keyword is a built-in function to include external modules that are present in separate files. or elese  require() statement basically reads a JavaScript file, and then 
executes it, and then proceeds to return the export object

Different types of Modules
Core 				Local
Third Party			User-defined
Built-in Module,


HTTP   				vs HTTPs

Implementation of HTTP
const http=require('http');


let app=http.createServer((req,res)=>{
console.log(req.url);
});


app.listen(3000,()=>{
console.log("Server listening")
}
